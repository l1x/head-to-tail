# head-to-tail

A simple Clojure app for solving the head to tail problem. Be aware there are 
different versions of this problem. This implementation is a more relaxed one,
in terms of changing letters. It uses the popular graph library Loom and gets all
of the words into a graph first. This step takes the longest.
